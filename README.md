Week 2 Quiz

What is a TabBarController (what are its uses)?

A TabBarController is a powerful UI component for iOS apps. It is used to group view controllers together and this is known as a container view. TabBarController gives access to the most important screens of the app. TabBarController is in the class of UITabBarController. It organises 3-5 controllers in a group. The user can switch between view controllers by simply tapping on one of the tabs in the tab bar at the bottom of the screen. 

What is autoLayout?

AutoLayout constraints is where views can be created that dynamically adjust to a different size classes and positions. The autoLayout constraint will ensure that views adjust to any size changes without the need of manually updating the frames or positions. 

What is a segue?

Segues are visual connectors between view controllers in storyboards, where it is shown as lines between the two controllers. They allow you to present one view controller from another, optionally using adaptive presentation so different electronic devices behave one way from the other, for example between an iPad and iPhone. 

What methods are needed to build Tableviews?

ViewDidLoad(), numberOfSections, tableView(UITableView, Int) -> Int, tableView(UITableView, IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell

What is a closure?

Closure is a type of function where is a function name is not required. It captures and stores references to any variable and constants in the context they are defined. It can be passed around like a variable.

Are there any protocols we must conform to build Tableviews?

TableViewDelegate

Do you prefer to build your controllers in storyboard or programmatically?

I prefer to build my controllers in storyboard, however, doing it programmatically is interesting and always challenging for me. 

What is a CollectionView?

CollectionView is a collaboration between various objects, including:
•	Cells (dequeueReusuableCell(withReuseIdentifier: for: ) )
•	Layouts (UICollectionViewLayout)
•	Data source object (UICollectionViewDataSource)
•	Delegate object (UICollectionViewDelegate)
•	Collection view controller (UICollectionViewController)

A collection view handles an ordered set of content, for example the photos app in iPhone is presented visually in a grid format.

Collection view provides two prefetching techniques which is used to improve responsiveness: Cell prefetching and Data prefetching. 

How does a UINavigationController work (what does it do)?

UINavigationController is a container view controller that handles one or more child view controllers in a navigation interface. With this type of interface, only one type of view controller is visible at a time. It uses an ordered array to manage child view controllers, known as navigation stack.

Navigation controller handles the creation, configuration and display of the navigation bar and optional navigation toolbar. 

Tell me about a time you had to work to overcome a particular engineering challenge?

Within this field, the challenge I overcame was coding programmatically. I struggled a lot in the beginning to get a hold of it and understand what each line of code does or mean. I overcame it by practicing it and getting used to the programmatic way.
